Hello everyone in this tech world I find my self
 in.
My pursuit of self build ev ownership finds me
Feeling much like Richard Dreyfuss in close 
encounters film.
Yes you have to be of a certain age.
This affliction has become much like the
 mountain he builds in his lounge, messy but 
Inevitable.
I am a petrol head with many years of electrical 
skills, welding and mechanical etc but will need
Electronics help. I am willing to collaborate 
Where ever I can help.
Damiens brush motor low cost ev is my initial 
Aim, I feel it is not only very achievable but
The very least every D I Y petrol head can do to
Help save the planet in the light of present
Events. 
Hope I can be of help.
